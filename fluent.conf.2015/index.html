                <h1>OVERVIEW: O'REILLY Fluent Conference 2015 - The Web Platform San Francisco, CA </h1>
                <p>Fluent is for everyone who has a hand in web development, from front-end to back-end and everything in between. Get practical training on the latest in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and the frameworks that build on those technologies.</p>

                <h2>THE MUST-ATTEND GATHERING OF WEB PROFESSIONALS:</h2>
                <p>Fluent spotlights the emerging methods, tools, and technologies of the Web Platform. Developers, software engineers, UX/UI designers, and other web professionals come to Fluent to share their experiences and expertise—and to learn what they need to know to stay competitive.</p>

                <h2>3 THINGS WE DID AT FLUENT:</h2>
                <p>-1. Learn about the entire web stack. Fluent is the only conference that encompasses every major (and emerging) web technology and tool of the web stack, including: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Angular, Ember, Backbone, and Underscore. More importantly, you'll see how all the pieces fit together. You’ll learn about the UX design, engineering best practices, and back-end content that affects front-end developers. And you'll be able to easily compare tools and frameworks so you can figure out how best to tackle a project.</p>

          			<p>-2. Meet the brightest minds in web development. Fluent attracts the leading experts and innovators in every facet of the web platform. Over 75 speakers will share their hard-won expertise with you. You'll have the chance to ask questions specific to your projects during Office Hours and Flocks. And you'll interact with hundreds of your peers—web professionals who are facing (and conquering) the same problems you face every day.</p>

          			<p>-3. Get even better at what you do. At Fluent, you'll learn what works (and what doesn't) in the real world. With case studies and tales from the trenches, you'll learn best practices, save time, and dodge the pitfalls that have vexed others. Solving just one gnarly problem will more than pay back the cost the conference. Think about your biggest work headache and then scan Fluent's agenda. Odds are you'll find the answers you need.</p>

                        <div class="entry_content_area">
                          <p>The mobile Web continues to be a challenging place for developers and user alike. In this workshop, attendees will learn how to diagnose the many different types of compatibility issues that occur in different mobile browsers.</p>
                            
                          <p>In this workshop we covered tooling and techniques for debugging (and hopefully fixing) JavaScript, CSS, and HTTP issues. These issues are based on real compatibility bugs reported to browser vendors.</p>

                            <p>Responsive design is a specific technique, defined with three parts: a grid system, media queries, and responsive images. You can use a framework like Bootstrap or Foundation to build a responsive website, but many object to framework "bloat". How can you build your own grid system and media queries from scratch? How can you manage responsive images? This workshop will walk you through all three areas.</p>
                            
                            <p>In this workshop you’ll have a good start at a grid system of your own, integrating media queries and a responsive image system, and maybe you’ll have a bit more appreciation for the responsive design frameworks as well!</p>
