                <h1>OVERVIEW: O'REILLY Fluent Conference 2015 - The Web Platform San Francisco, CA </h1>
                <p>Fluent is for everyone who has a hand in web development, from front-end to back-end and everything in between. Get practical training on the latest in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and the frameworks that build on those technologies.</p>

                <h2>THE MUST-ATTEND GATHERING OF WEB PROFESSIONALS:</h2>
                <p>Fluent spotlights the emerging methods, tools, and technologies of the Web Platform. Developers, software engineers, UX/UI designers, and other web professionals come to Fluent to share their experiences and expertise—and to learn what they need to know to stay competitive.</p>

                <h2>3 THINGS WE DID AT FLUENT:</h2>
                <p>-1. Learn about the entire web stack. Fluent is the only conference that encompasses every major (and emerging) web technology and tool of the web stack, including: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Angular, Ember, Backbone, and Underscore. More importantly, you'll see how all the pieces fit together. You’ll learn about the UX design, engineering best practices, and back-end content that affects front-end developers. And you'll be able to easily compare tools and frameworks so you can figure out how best to tackle a project.</p>

          			<p>-2. Meet the brightest minds in web development. Fluent attracts the leading experts and innovators in every facet of the web platform. Over 75 speakers will share their hard-won expertise with you. You'll have the chance to ask questions specific to your projects during Office Hours and Flocks. And you'll interact with hundreds of your peers—web professionals who are facing (and conquering) the same problems you face every day.</p>

          			<p>-3. Get even better at what you do. At Fluent, you'll learn what works (and what doesn't) in the real world. With case studies and tales from the trenches, you'll learn best practices, save time, and dodge the pitfalls that have vexed others. Solving just one gnarly problem will more than pay back the cost the conference. Think about your biggest work headache and then scan Fluent's agenda. Odds are you'll find the answers you need.</p>

                        <div class="entry_content_area">
                          <p>The mobile Web continues to be a challenging place for developers and user alike. In this workshop, attendees will learn how to diagnose the many different types of compatibility issues that occur in different mobile browsers.</p>
                            
                          <p>In this workshop we covered tooling and techniques for debugging (and hopefully fixing) JavaScript, CSS, and HTTP issues. These issues are based on real compatibility bugs reported to browser vendors.</p>

                            <p>Responsive design is a specific technique, defined with three parts: a grid system, media queries, and responsive images. You can use a framework like Bootstrap or Foundation to build a responsive website, but many object to framework "bloat". How can you build your own grid system and media queries from scratch? How can you manage responsive images? This workshop will walk you through all three areas.</p>
                            
                            <p>In this workshop you’ll have a good start at a grid system of your own, integrating media queries and a responsive image system, and maybe you’ll have a bit more appreciation for the responsive design frameworks as well!</p>

                            <p>During the first practical section of this class they went over the main techniques and tools available today using real mobile devices on stage, covering:</p>

                              <li>Remote Inspector tools</li>

                            <p>Finally we will see examples of techniques that are harming the performance on mobile web and the tips to achieve Extreme Web Performance.</p>
                            
                            <p>We were able to test live on our own mobile device for performance, including:</p>

                            <ul>
                              <li>Vertical Scrolling</li>

                              <li>JavaScript frameworks usage</li>
                              <li>Large DOM vs iframes vs object pool</li>
                              <li>SVG vs icon fonts vs responsive images</li>
                              <li>Custom fonts loading</li>
                              <li>Hacks to improve performance perception and responsiveness</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>After this class we got the full picture of HTML5 on mobile browsers today, how to measure performance on them and best practices to deliver the fastest experience on mobile browsers and webapp platforms.</p>

                          <p>we explored functional programming concepts, which help us create powerful abstractions to master complex problems and create more simple and elegant programs.</p>

                          <p>The widely used multi-paradigm language JavaScript allows us to ease into the functional programming style, letting us focus just on the new concepts, without the distraction of learning a specific functional programming language at the same time.</p>

                          <p>To make the dry functional programming concepts more digestible, we use cooking as an analogy.
                          And since the logician Haskell Curry invented functional programming and even has a function with his name, we combine our journey in JavaScript with examples and recipes for tasty curry dishes.</p>

                          <p>So even if you get stuck on concepts like higher order functions, continuation passing style or monads, you will at least not go home hungry.</p>

                          <p>This class covered a collection of our favorite parts of functional programming, starting from anonymous functions and closures, via recursion and higher order functions, map, reduce and filter, to more advanced concepts like monads and continuation passing style.</p>

                          Stefanie Schirmer is a Software Engineer at Etsy and an alumna of Hacker School in New York.</p>

                          <p>She studied Applied Computer Science in the Natural Sciences in Bielefeld, Germany, where she developed a type checker for a compiler of a DSL for dynamic programming. In her following PhD project she developed metrics for the structure comparison of RNA molecules using forests which represent the molecule structure. Working as a postdoc at Université de Montréal, she found her way to Hacker School and Etsy.</p>

                          <p>Together with Hannes Mehnert and Jens Ohlig she wrote a book on functional programming in JavaScript and curry cooking (Das Curry-Buch, O’Reilly Germany), which is currently being translated into English.</p>

                            <p>AngularJS and Ionic have emerged as the go-to stack for building hybrid applications that behave like native applications on the different mobile platforms. In this session, you will learn what set AngularJS and Ionic apart, how to build an Ionic application from scratch using the Ionic CLI, and how to architect the key components of an Ionic app with Services, Controllers, and Views.</p>

                              <li>Modify the app: create a service, a controller and a view</li>
                              <li>Run and debug the app on device</li>
